###The Project###

● Mike, a freelance Web Designer based out of Atlanta, hired me to optimise his website<br>
● My goal was to boost Mike’s local clients, improve his overall SEO and accessibility, and enhance the site’s mobile UI<br>
● To help me make the necessary changes, I used Lighthouse (an open-source Google
auditing tool), the WCAG guidelines, the W3C Markup Validation Service<br>

To see before and after results and the steps that were taken to do that, please check the "Optimization_Report" in this repository
