###The project###

● Mike, a freelance Web Designer based out of Atlanta, hired me to optimise his website
● My goal was to boost Mike’s local clients, improve his overall SEO and accessibility, and enhance the site’s mobile UI
● To help me make the necessary changes, I used Lighthouse (an open-source Google
auditing tool), the WCAG guidelines, the W3C Markup Validation Service

To see before and after result and the steps that were taken to do that, please check the "Optimization_Report" in this repository
